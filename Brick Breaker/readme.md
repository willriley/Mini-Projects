### So I made this Brick Breaker game...

And, using mouse listeners and such to control the paddle and the ACM library to help with
displaying st√ºf, I've somewhat rekindled the olden days when Blackberrys ruled and everyone played
Brick Breaker incessantly. 


As for dealing with collisions, I imagined the circular ball as a square and looped through 
4 main points on the periphery, checking if it hit any brick.

Some cherries on top included adding a score counter and increasing the ball's velocity with
every collision, just so you'd never really cruise to victory.
