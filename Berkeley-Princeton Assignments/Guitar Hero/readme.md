#### The inspiration from this assignment came from [here](http://cs61b.ug/sp16/materials/hw/hw1/hw1.html) and [here](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr16/cos126/assignments/guitar.html).

Thanks to interfaces, abstract classes, generics, and a pretty chill Karplus-Strong algorithm, I was able to simulate the plucking 
of a guitar string. It's also dependent on Princeton's StdDraw and StdAudio libraries.

The GuitarHero.java file forms a 37-note keyboard, with each key ranging in frequency from 110Hz to 880Hz. If you want to 
try it out, typing in "i p z v b z p b n z p n d [ i d z p i p z p i u i i" plays the beginning of *Stairway to Heaven* and
"nn//SS/ ..,,mmn //..,,m //..,,m nn//SS/ ..,,mmn" (where S = space) for *Twinkle Twinkle Little Star*.
